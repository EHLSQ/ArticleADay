- Narrow your scope, establish a clear focus
- "You can only achieve perfection when nothing is left to take away and not when you have nothing more to add."
- Thinking about what to remove instead of add forces you to think about the core features that would be important to your end user. 
- Minimalistic web design !== simple site structure. An intelligent layout may be hard to design but is critical for a minimalistic website.
